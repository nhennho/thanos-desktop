# 🌌 ThanOS: Handcrafted Titan Edition
ThanOS is a custom, high-performance Linux environment running on Android via Termux. This repository contains my personal configurations, scripts, and the soul of a Titan.

## ✨ Features
 Titan's Wrath: Thanos will humiliate you every time you type a command incorrectly, instead of  "command-not-found". 
 Custom Neofetch: The Debian logo was replaced with the Infinity Gauntlet, and the information was changed to purple.
  Theme and icons: I can't finalize them yet because they're too complex; you can change them to Papirus icons if you want.
